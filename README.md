# Hello App Store

This is a barebones Python app that can be submitted to the Mac App Store.

It displays a simple dialog and exits.

## Status: <span style="color:red">IN PROGRESS</span>

Current issues:

* The contrib module [wxPython] depends on QuickTime APIs, which is prohibited on the Mac App Store. I am currently following up with wxPython devs to find a workaround.
